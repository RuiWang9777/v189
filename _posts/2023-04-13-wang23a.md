title: Constrained Contrastive Reinforcement Learning
crossref: acml22
abstract: "Learning to control from complex observations\r remains a major challenge
  in the application of\r model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL). Existing\r MBRL
  methods apply contrastive learning to replace\r pixel-level reconstruction, improving
  the\r performance of the latent world model. However,\r previous contrastive learning
  approaches in MBRL\r fail to utilize task-relevant information, making it\r difficult
  to aggregate observations with the same\r task-relevant information but the different\r
  task-irrelevant information in latent space. In this\r work, we first propose Constrained
  Contrastive\r Reinforcement Learning (C2RL), an MBRL method that\r learns a world
  model through a combination of two\r contrastive losses based on latent dynamics
  and\r task-relevant state abstraction respectively,\r utilizing reward information
  to accelerate model\r learning. Then, we propose a hyperparameter $\\beta$\r to
  balance two kinds of contrastive losses to\r strengthen the representation ability
  of the latent\r dynamics. The experimental results show that our\r approach outperforms
  state-of-the-art methods in\r both the natural video and standard background\r setting
  on challenging DMControl tasks."
