title: "Pose Guided Human Image Synthesis with Partially\r Decoupled GAN"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "Pose Guided Human Image Synthesis (PGHIS) is a\r challenging task of transforming
  a human image from\r the reference pose to a target pose while preserving\r its
  style. Most existing methods encode the texture\r of the whole reference human image
  into a latent\r space, and then utilize a decoder to synthesize the\r image texture
  of the target pose. However, it is\r difficult to recover the detailed texture of
  the\r whole human image. To alleviate this problem, we\r propose a method by decoupling
  the human body into\r several parts (\\emph{e.g.}, hair, face, hands, feet,\r \\emph{etc.})
  and then using each of these parts to\r guide the synthesis of a realistic image
  of the\r person, which preserves the detailed information of\r the generated images.
  In addition, we design a\r multi-head attention-based module for PGHIS. Because\r
  most convolutional neural network-based methods have\r difficulty in modeling long-range
  dependency due to\r the convolutional operation, the long-range modeling\r capability
  of attention mechanism is more suitable\r than convolutional neural networks for
  pose transfer\r task, especially for sharp pose\r deformation. Extensive experiments
  on Market-1501\r and DeepFashion datasets reveal that our method\r almost outperforms
  other existing state-of-the-art\r methods in terms of both qualitative and\r quantitative
  metrics."
