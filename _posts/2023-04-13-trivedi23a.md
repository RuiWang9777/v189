title: "Noise Robust Core-stable Coalitions of Hedonic\r Games"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "In this work, we consider the coalition formation\r games with an additional
  component, ‘noisy\r preferences’. Moreover, such noisy preferences are\r available
  only for a sample of coalitions. We\r propose a multiplicative noise model (equivalent
  to\r an additive noise model) and obtain the prediction\r probability, defined as
  the probability that the\r estimated PAC core-stable partition of the\r \\emph{noisy}
  game is also PAC core-stable for the\r \\emph{unknown noise-free} game.  This prediction\r
  probability depends on the probability of a\r combinatorial construct called an
  ‘agreement\r event’. We explicitly obtain the agreement\r probability for $n$ agent
  noisy game with $l\\geq 2$\r support noise distribution. For a user-given\r satisfaction
  value on this probability, we identify\r the noise regimes for which an estimated
  partition\r is noise robust; that is, it is PAC core-stable in\r both the noisy
  and noise-free games. We obtain\r similar robustness results when the estimated\r
  partition is not PAC core-stable. These noise\r regimes correspond to the level
  sets of the\r agreement probability function and are non-convex\r sets. Moreover,
  an important fact is that the\r prediction probability can be high even if high\r
  noise values occur with a high probability. Further,\r for a class of top-responsive
  hedonic games, we\r obtain the bounds on the extra noisy samples\r required to get
  noise robustness with a user-given\r satisfaction value.  We completely solve the
  noise\r robustness problem of a $2$ agent hedonic game. In\r particular, we obtain
  the prediction probability\r function for $l=2$ and $l=3$ noise support\r cases.
  For $l=2$, the prediction probability is\r convex in noise probability, but the
  noise robust\r regime is non-convex. Its minimum value, called the\r safety value,
  is 0.62; so, below 0.62, the noise\r robust regime is the entire probability\r simplex.
  However, for $l \\geq 3$, the prediction\r probability is non-convex; so, the safety
  value is\r the global minima of a non-convex function and is\r computationally hard."
