title: "Position-dependent partial convolutions for\r supervised spatial interpolation"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "Acquiring continuous spatial data, e.g., spatial\r ground motion is essential
  to assess the damaged\r area and appropriately assign rescue and medical\r teams.
  To this purpose, spatial interpolation\r methods have been developed to estimate
  the value of\r unobserved points linearly from neighbor observed\r values, i.e.,
  inverse distance weighting and\r Kriging. Recently, realistic spatial continuous\r
  environmental data with various scenarios can be\r generated by 3D finite difference
  methods with a\r high-resolution structure model. It enables us to\r collect supervised
  data even for unobserved\r points. Along this line, we propose a framework of\r
  supervised spatial interpolation and apply highly\r advanced deep inpainting methods
  where we treat\r spatially distributed observed points as a masked\r image and non-linearly
  expand them through\r convolutional encoder-decoder networks. However, the\r property
  of translation invariance would avoid\r locally fine-grained interpolation since
  the\r relation between the target and surrounding\r observation points varies over
  regions due to its\r topography and subsurface structure. To overcome\r this problem,
  we propose introducing\r position-dependent convolution where kernel weights\r are
  adjusted depending on their position on an image\r based on the trainable position-feature
  map. We show\r the effectiveness of our proposed method, called,\r PoDIM (Position-dependent
  Deep Inpainting Method),\r through experiments using simulated ground-motion\r data."
