title: "3D Manifold Topology Based Medical Image Data\r Augmentation"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "Data augmentation is an effective and universal\r technique for improving
  the generalization\r performance of deep neural networks. Current data\r augmentation
  implementations usually involve\r geometric and photometric transformations. However,\r
  none of them considers the topological information\r in images, which is an important
  global invariant of\r the three-dimensional manifold. In our\r implementation, we
  design a novel method that finds\r the generator of the first homology group,\r
  i.e. closed loops cannot shrink to a point, of 3D\r image and erases the bounding
  box of a random\r loop. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first\r time that
  data augmentation based on the first\r homology group of the three-dimensional image
  is\r applied in medical image augmentation. Our numerical\r experiments demonstrate
  that the proposed approach\r outperforms the state-of-the-art method."
