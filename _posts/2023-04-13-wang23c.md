title: "Evaluating the perceived safety of urban city via\r maximum entropy deep inverse
  reinforcement learning"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "Inspired by expert evaluation policy for urban\r perception, we proposed
  a novel inverse\r reinforcement learning (IRL) based framework for\r predicting
  urban safety and recovering the\r corresponding reward function. We also presented
  a\r scalable state representation method to model the\r prediction problem as a
  Markov decision process\r (MDP) and use reinforcement learning (RL) to solve\r the
  problem. Additionally, we built a dataset called\r SmallCity based on the crowdsourcing
  method to\r conduct the research. As far as we know, this is the\r first time the
  IRL approach has been introduced to\r the urban safety perception and planning field
  to\r help experts quantitatively analyze perceptual\r features. Our results showed
  that IRL has promising\r prospects in this field. We will later open-source\r the
  crowdsourcing data collection site and the model\r proposed in this paper."
