title: "BeautifAI - Personalised Occasion-based Makeup\r Recommendation"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "With the global metamorphosis of the beauty industry\r and the rising demand
  for beauty products worldwide,\r the need for a robust makeup recommendation system\r
  has never been more. Despite the significant\r advancements made towards personalised
  makeup\r recommendation, the current research still falls\r short of incorporating
  the context of occasion and\r integrating feedback for users. In this work, we\r
  propose BeautifAI, a novel recommendation system,\r delivering personalised occasion-oriented
  makeup\r recommendations to users. The proposed workâ€™s novel\r contributions, including
  incorporating occasion\r context to makeup recommendation and a region-wise\r method
  using neural embeddings, set our system apart\r from the current work in makeup
  recommendation. We\r also propose real-time makeup previews and\r continuous makeup
  feedback to provide a more\r personalised and interactive experience to users."
