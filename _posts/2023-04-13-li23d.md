title: "AIIR-MIX: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Meets\r Attention Individual
  Intrinsic Reward Mixing\r Network"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "Deducing the contribution of each agent and\r assigning the corresponding
  reward to them is a\r crucial problem in cooperative Multi-Agent\r Reinforcement
  Learning (MARL). Previous studies try\r to resolve the issue through designing an
  intrinsic\r reward function, but the intrinsic reward is simply\r combined with
  the environment reward by summation in\r these studies, which makes the performance
  of their\r MARL framework unsatisfactory. We propose a novel\r method named Attention
  Individual Intrinsic Reward\r Mixing Network (AIIR-MIX) in MARL, and the\r contributions
  of AIIR-MIX are listed as follows:\r \\textbf{(a)} we construct a novel intrinsic
  reward\r network based on the attention mechanism to make\r teamwork more effective.
  \\textbf{(b)} we propose a\r Mixing network that is able to combine intrinsic and\r
  extrinsic rewards non-linearly and dynamically in\r response to changing conditions
  of the\r environment. We compare AIIR-MIX with many\r State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) MARL
  methods on battle games\r in StarCraft II. And the results demonstrate that\r AIIR-MIX
  performs admirably and can defeat the\r current advanced methods on average test
  win\r rate. To validate the effectiveness of AIIR-MIX, we\r conduct additional ablation
  studies. The results\r show that AIIR-MIX can dynamically assign each agent\r a
  real-time intrinsic reward in accordance with\r their actual contribution."
