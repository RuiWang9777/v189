title: "Layer-wise Adaptive Graph Convolution Networks Using\r Generalized Pagerank"
crossref: acml22
abstract: " We investigate adaptive layer-wise graph\r convolution in deep GCN models.
  We propose AdaGPR to\r learn generalized Pageranks at each layer of a GCNII\r network
  to induce adaptive convolution. We show that\r the generalization bound for AdaGPR
  is bounded by a\r polynomial of the eigenvalue spectrum of the\r normalized adjacency
  matrix in the order of the\r number of generalized Pagerank coefficients.  By\r
  analysing the generalization bounds we show that\r oversmoothing depends on both
  the convolutions by\r the higher orders of the normalized adjacency matrix\r and
  the depth of the model.  We performed\r evaluations on node-classification using
  benchmark\r real data and show that AdaGPR provides improved\r accuracies compared
  to existing graph convolution\r networks while demonstrating robustness against\r
  oversmoothing. Further, we demonstrate that analysis\r of coefficients of layer-wise
  generalized Pageranks\r allows us to qualitatively understand convolution at\r each
  layer enabling model interpretations."
