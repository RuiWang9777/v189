title: "Value Function Approximations via Kernel Embeddings\r for No-Regret Reinforcement
  Learning"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "We consider the regret minimization problem in\r reinforcement learning
  (RL) in the episodic setting.\r In many real-world RL environments, the state and\r
  action spaces are continuous or very large. Existing\r approaches establish regret
  guarantees by either a\r low-dimensional representation of the stochastic\r transition
  model or an approximation of the\r $Q$-functions. However, the understanding of\r
  function approximation schemes for state-value\r functions largely remains missing.
  In this paper, we\r propose an online model-based RL algorithm, namely\r the CME-RL,
  that learns embeddings of the\r state-transition distribution in a reproducing\r
  kernel Hilbert space while carefully balancing the\r exploitation-exploration tradeoff.
  We demonstrate\r the efficiency of our algorithm by proving a\r frequentist (worst-case)
  regret bound that is of\r order\r $\\tilde{O}\\big(H\\gamma_N\\sqrt{N}\\big)$\\footnote{\r
  $\\tilde{O}(\\cdot)$ hides only absolute constant and\r poly-logarithmic factors.},
  where $H$ is the episode\r length, $N$ is the total number of time steps and\r $\\gamma_N$
  is an information theoretic quantity\r relating the effective dimension of the state-action\r
  feature space. Our method bypasses the need for\r estimating transition probabilities
  and applies to\r any domain on which kernels can be defined. It also\r brings new
  insights into the general theory of\r kernel methods for approximate inference and
  RL\r regret minimization."
