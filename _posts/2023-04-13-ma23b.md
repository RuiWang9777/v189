title: "Asynchronous Personalized Federated Learning with\r Irregular Clients"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "To provide intelligent and personalized models for\r clients, personalized
  federated learning (PFL)\r enables learning from data, identifying patterns,\r and
  making automated decisions in a\r privacy-preserving manner. PFL involves independent\r
  training for multiple clients with synchronous\r aggregation steps. However, the
  assumptions made by\r existing works are not realistic given the\r heterogeneity
  of clients. In particular, the volume\r and distribution of collected data vary
  in the\r training process, and the clients also vary in their\r available system
  configurations, which leads to vast\r heterogeneity in the system. To address these\r
  challenges, we present an \\textit{asynchronous}\r method (AsyPFL), where clients
  learn personalized\r models w.r.t. local data by making the most\r informative parameters
  less volatile. The central\r server aggregates model parameters\r asynchronously.
  In addition, we also reformulate PFL\r by unifying both synchronous and asynchronous\r
  updating schemes with an asynchrony-related\r parameter. Theoretically, we show
  that AsyPFLâ€™s\r convergence rate is state-of-the-art and provide\r guarantees of
  choosing key hyperparameters\r optimally. With these theoretical guarantees, we\r
  validate AsyPFL on different tasks with non-IID and\r staleness settings. The results
  indicate that, given\r a large proportion of irregular clients, AsyPFL\r excels
  at empirical performance compared with\r vanilla PFL algorithms on non-IID and IID
  cases."
