title: When to Classify Events in Open Times Series?
crossref: acml22
abstract: "In numerous applications, for instance in predictive\r maintenance, there
  is a pression to predict events\r ahead of time with as much accuracy as possible\r
  while not delaying the decision unduly. This\r translates in the optimization of
  a trade-off\r between earliness and accuracy of the decisions,\r that has been the
  subject of research for time\r series of finite length and with a unique label.
  And\r this has led to powerful algorithms for Early\r Classification of Time Series
  (ECTS). This paper,\r for the first time, investigates such a trade-off\r when events
  of different classes occur in a\r streaming fashion, with no predefined end.  In
  the\r Early Classification in Open Time Series problem\r (ECOTS), the task is to
  predict events, i.e. their\r class and time interval, at the moment that\r optimizes
  the accuracy vs. earliness\r trade-off. Interestingly, we find that ECTS\r algorithms
  can be sensibly adapted in a principled\r way to this new problem.  We illustrate
  our\r methodology by transforming two state-of-the-art\r ECTS algorithms for the
  ECOTS scenario.Among the\r wide variety of applications that this new approach\r
  opens up, we develop here a predictive maintenance\r use case that optimizes alarm
  triggering times, thus\r demonstrating the power of this new approach. "
