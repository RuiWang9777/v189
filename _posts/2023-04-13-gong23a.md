title: "Circulant-interactive Transformer with\r Dimension-aware Fusion for Multimodal
  Sentiment\r Analysis"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) is gaining\r traction as a critical
  tool for understanding human\r behavior and enabling a wide range of\r applications.
  Since data of different modalities\r might lie in completely distinct spaces, it
  is very\r challenging to perform effective fusion and analysis\r from asynchronous
  multimodal streams. Most of\r previous works focused on aligned fusion, which is\r
  unpractical in real-world scenarios. The recent\r Multimodal Transformer (MulT)
  approach attends to\r model the correlations between elements from\r different modalities
  in an unaligned\r manner. However, it collects temporal information by\r self-attention
  transformer which is a sequence\r model, implying that interactions across distinct\r
  time steps are not sufficient. In this paper, we\r propose the Citculant-interactive
  Transformer\r Network with dimension-aware fusion (CITN-DAF),\r which enables parallel
  computation of different\r modalities among different time steps and alleviates\r
  inter-modal temporal sensitivity while preserving\r intra-modal semantic order.
  By incorporating\r circulant matrices into the cross-modal attention\r mechanism,
  CITN-DAF is aimed to examine all\r conceivable interactions between vectors of\r
  different modalities. In addition, a dimension-aware\r fusion method is presented,
  which projects feature\r representations into different subspaces for an\r in-depth
  fusion. We evaluate CITN-DAF on three\r commonly used sentiment analysis benchmarks\r
  including CMU-MOSEI, CMU-MOSI and IEMOCAP. Extensive\r experimental results reveal
  that CITN-DAF is\r superior in cross-modal semantic interactions and\r outperforms
  the state-of-the-art multimodal\r methods."
