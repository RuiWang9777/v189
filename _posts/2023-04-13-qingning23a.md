title: "Multi-Scale Anomaly Detection for Time Series with\r Attention-based Recurrent
  Autoencoders"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "Anomaly detection on time series is an important\r research topic in data
  mining, which has a wide\r range of applications in financial markets,\r biological
  data, information technology,\r manufacturing system, etc. However, the existing\r
  time series anomaly detection methods mainly capture\r temporal features from a
  single-scale viewpoint,\r which cannot detect multi-scale anomalies\r effectively.
  In this paper, we propose a novel\r approach of Multi-scale Anomaly Detection for
  Time\r Series (MAD-TS) with an attention-based recurrent\r autoencoder model to
  solve the above problem. The\r proposed method adopts a hierarchically connected\r
  recurrent encoder to extract the features of a time\r series from different levels.
  The multi-scale\r features are then fused by a hierarchical decoder\r with attention
  mechanism to reconstruct the original\r sequence at different scales. Based on the\r
  reconstruction errors at multiple scales, anomaly\r scores can be learned for different
  data points,\r which can be used to infer the anomaly status of the\r time series.
  Extensive experiments based on five\r open time series datasets show that the proposed\r
  MAD-TS method achieves significant performance\r improvement on anomaly detection
  compared to the\r state-of-the-arts."
