title: "Out of Distribution Detection via Neural Network\r Anchoring"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "Our goal in this paper is to exploit heteroscedastic\r temperature scaling
  as a calibration strategy for\r out of distribution (OOD)\r detection. Heteroscedasticity
  here refers to the\r fact that the optimal temperature parameter for each\r sample
  can be different, as opposed to conventional\r approaches that use the same value
  for the entire\r distribution. To enable this, we propose a new\r training strategy
  called anchoring that can estimate\r appropriate temperature values for each sample,\r
  leading to state-of-the-art OOD detection\r performance across several benchmarks.
  Using NTK\r theory, we show that this temperature function\r estimate is closely
  linked to the epistemic\r uncertainty of the classifier, which explains its\r behavior.
  In contrast to some of the best-performing\r OOD detection approaches, our method
  does not\r require exposure to additional outlier datasets,\r custom calibration
  objectives, or model\r ensembling. Through empirical studies with different\r OOD
  detection settings â€“ far OOD, near OOD, and\r semantically coherent OOD - we establish
  a highly\r effective OOD detection approach."
