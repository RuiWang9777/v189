title: "Efficient Deep Clustering of Human Activities and\r How to Improve Evaluation"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "There has been much recent research on human\r activity recognition (HAR),
  due to the proliferation\r of wearable sensors in watches and phones, and the\r
  advances of deep learning methods, which avoid the\r need to manually extract features
  from raw sensor\r signals. A significant disadvantage of deep learning\r applied
  to HAR is the need for manually labelled\r training data, which is especially difficult
  to\r obtain for HAR datasets. Progress is starting to be\r made in the unsupervised
  setting, in the form of\r deep HAR clustering models, which can assign labels\r
  to data without having been given any labels to\r train on, but there are problems
  with evaluating\r deep HAR clustering models, which makes assessing\r the field
  and devising new methods difficult. In\r this paper, we highlight several distinct
  problems\r with how deep HAR clustering models are evaluated,\r describing these
  problems in detail and conducting\r careful experiments to explicate the effect
  that\r they can have on results. Additionally, we present a\r new deep clustering
  model for HAR. When tested under\r our proposed settings, our model performs better\r
  than (or on par with) existing models, while also\r being more efficient and scalable
  by avoiding the\r need for an autoencoder."
