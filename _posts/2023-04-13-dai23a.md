title: "Multiple Imputation with Neural Network Gaussian\r Process for High-dimensional
  Incomplete Data"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "Missing data are ubiquitous in real world\r applications and, if not adequately
  handled, may\r lead to the loss of information and biased findings\r in downstream
  analysis. Particularly,\r high-dimensional incomplete data with a moderate\r sample
  size, such as analysis of multi-omics data,\r present daunting challenges. Imputation
  is arguably\r the most popular method for handling missing data,\r though existing
  imputation methods have a number of\r limitations. Single imputation methods such
  as\r matrix completion methods do not adequately account\r for imputation uncertainty
  and hence would yield\r improper statistical inference. In contrast,\r multiple
  imputation (MI) methods allow for proper\r inference but existing methods do not
  perform well\r in high-dimensional settings. Our work aims to\r address these significant
  methodological gaps,\r leveraging recent advances in neural network\r Gaussian process
  (NNGP) from a Bayesian\r viewpoint. We propose two NNGP-based MI methods,\r namely
  MI-NNGP, that can apply multiple imputations\r for missing values from a joint (posterior\r
  predictive) distribution. The MI-NNGP methods are\r shown to significantly outperform
  existing\r state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real\r datasets, in terms of
  imputation error, statistical\r inference, robustness to missing rates, and\r computation
  costs, under three missing data\r mechanisms, MCAR, MAR, and MNAR."
