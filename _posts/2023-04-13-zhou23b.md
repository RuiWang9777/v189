title: "Multi-scale Progressive Gated Transformer for\r Physiological Signal Classification"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "Physiological signal classification is of great\r significance for health
  monitoring and medical\r diagnosis. Deep learning-based methods (e.g. RNN and\r
  CNN) have been used in this domain to obtain\r reliable predictions. However, the
  performance of\r existing methods is constrained by the long-term\r dependence and
  irregular vibration of the univariate\r physiological signal sequence. To overcome
  these\r limitations, this paper proposes a Multi-scale\r Progressive Gated Transformer
  (MPGT) model to learn\r multi-scale temporal representations for better\r physiological
  signal classification. The key\r novelties of MPGT are the proposed Multi-scale\r
  Temporal Feature extraction (MTF) and Progressive\r Gated Transformer (PGT). The
  former adopts coarse-\r and fine-grained feature extractors to project the\r input
  signal data into different temporal\r granularity embedding spaces and the latter\r
  integrates such multi-scale information for data\r representation. Classification
  task is then\r conducted on the learned\r representations. Experimental results
  on real-world\r datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed\r model."
