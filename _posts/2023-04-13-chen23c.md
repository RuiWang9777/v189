  to Inexact Stochastic\r Recursive Gradient Algorithm"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "We provide a robust convergence analysis of the\r Riemannian gradient descent
  algorithm for computing\r the leading eigenvector of a real symmetric\r matrix.
  Our result characterizes the convergence\r behavior of the algorithm under the noisy
  updates,\r where noises can be generated by a stochastic\r process or could be chosen
  adversarially. The noisy\r Riemannian gradient descent has a broad range of\r applications
  in machine learning and statistics,\r e.g., streaming principal component analysis
  or\r privacy-preserving spectral analysis. In particular,\r we demonstrate the usefulness
  of our convergence\r bound with a new eigengap-dependent sample\r complexity of
  the inexact Riemannian stochastic\r recursive gradient algorithm, which utilizes\r
  mini-batch gradients instead of full gradients in\r outer loops. Our robust convergence
  paradigm\r strictly improves the state-of-the-art sample\r complexity in terms of
  the gap dependence."
