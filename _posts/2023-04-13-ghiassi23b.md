title: "Multi Label Loss Correction against Missing and\r Corrupted Labels"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "Missing and corrupted labels can significantly ruin\r the learning process
  and, consequently, the\r classifier performance. Multi-label learning where\r each
  instance is tagged with variable number of\r labels is particularly affected. Although
  missing\r labels (false-negatives) is a well-studied problem\r in multi-label learning,
  it is considerably more\r challenging to have both false-negatives (missing\r labels)
  and false-positives (corrupted labels)\r simultaneously in multi-label datasets.
  In this\r paper, we propose Multi-Label Loss with Self\r Correction (MLLSC) which
  is a loss robust against\r coincident missing and corrupted labels. MLLSC\r computes
  the loss based on the true-positive\r (true-negative) or false-positive (false-negative)\r
  labels and deep neural network expertise. To\r distinguish between false-positive
  (false-negative)\r and true-positive (true-negative) labels, we use the\r output
  probability of the deep neural network during\r the learning process. Our method
  As MLLSC can be\r combined with different types of multi-label loss\r functions,
  we also address the label imbalance\r problem of multi-label datasets. Empirical\r
  evaluation on real-world vision datasets, i.e.,\r MS-COCO, and MIR-FLICKR, shows
  that our method under\r medium (0.3) and high (0.6) corrupted and missing\r label
  probabilities outperform the state-of-the-art\r methods by, on average 23.97% and
  9.31% mean average\r precision (mAP) points, respectively."
