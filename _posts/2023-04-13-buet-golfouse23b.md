title: Fairness Trade-Offs and Partial Debiasing
crossref: acml22
abstract: "Previous literature has shown that bias mitigating\r algorithms were sometimes
  prone to overfitting and\r had poor out-of-sample generalisation. This paper is\r
  first and foremost concerned with establishing a\r mathematical framework to tackle
  the specific issue\r of generalisation. Throughout this work, we consider\r fairness
  trade-offs and objectives mixing\r statistical loss over the whole sample and fairness\r
  penalties on categories (which could stem from\r different values of protected attributes),\r
  encompassing partial de-biasing. We do so by\r adopting two different but complementary
  viewpoints:\r first, we consider a PAC-type setup and derive\r probabilistic upper
  bounds involving sample-only\r information; second, we leverage an asymptotic\r
  framework to derive a closed-form limiting\r distribution for the difference between
  the\r empirical trade-off and the true trade-off. While\r these results provide
  guarantees for learning\r fairness metrics across categories, they also point\r
  out to the key (but asymmetric) role played by class\r imbalance. To summarise,
  learning fairness without\r having access to enough category-level samples is\r
  hard, and a simple numerical experiment shows that\r it can lead to spurious results."
