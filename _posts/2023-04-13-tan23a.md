title: CVaR-Regret Bounds for Multi-armed Bandits
crossref: acml22
abstract: "In contrast to risk-averse multi-armed bandit (MAB),\r where one aims for
  a best risk-sensitive arm while\r having a risk-neutral attitude when running the\r
  risk-averse MAB algorithm, in this paper, we aim for\r a best arm with respect to
  the mean like in the\r standard MAB, but we adopt a risk-averse attitude\r when
  running a standard MAB algorithm. Conditional\r value-at-risk (CVaR) of the regret
  is adopted as the\r metric to evaluate the performance of algorithms,\r which is
  an extension of the traditional expected\r regret minimization framework. For this
  new problem,\r we revisit several classic algorithms for stochastic\r and non-stochastic
  bandits, UCB, MOSS, and Exp3-IX\r with its variants and propose parameters with
  good\r theoretically guaranteed CVaR-regret, which match\r the results of the expected
  regret and achieve\r (nearly-)optimality up to constant. In the\r non-stochastic
  setting, we show that implicit\r exploration achieves a trade-off between the\r
  variability of the regret and the regret in\r expectation. Numerical experiments
  are conducted to\r validate our results."
