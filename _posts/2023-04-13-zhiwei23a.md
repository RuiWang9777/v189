title: "Unsupervised Photo-to-Caricature Generation with\r Adaptive Select Layer-Instance
  Normalization and\r Semi-cycle Consistency"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "Unpaired photo to caricature generation is a\r challenging but meaningful
  task. Generating high\r quality caricatures with rich texture/color and\r plausible
  exaggeration is important. Previous\r methods often respectively deal with the shape\r
  transformation and texture/color style. We argue\r that shape transformation can
  be treated as same as\r texture/color. Thereby, shape transformation and\r texture/color
  can be transferred at the same\r time. In this paper, we proposed a new method namely\r
  AdsSe-GAN for photo-to-caricature generation, which\r consists of a new normalization
  function called\r AdaSLIN and a new semi-cycle consistency loss. The\r AdaSLIN adaptively
  selects Layer Normalization or\r Instance Normalization to simultaneously transfer\r
  texture/color and shape transformation. Besides we\r present semi-cycle consistency
  loss which only\r imposes L1 norm on caricature-to-photo process,\r which is different
  from existing methods that apply\r cycle consistency loss to preserve the original\r
  domain information. In fact, while generating\r caricature, taking no account of
  the cycle\r restriction makes our model generate caricature with\r more distinct
  exaggeration and higher\r quality. Experimental results on a public caricature\r
  dataset, WebCaricature, show the effectiveness of\r our proposed method compared
  with the\r state-of-the-art models."
