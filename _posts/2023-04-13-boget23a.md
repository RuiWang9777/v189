title: Graph annotation generative adversarial networks
crossref: acml22
abstract: "We consider the problem of modelling\r high-dimensional distributions and
  generating new\r examples of data with complex relational feature\r structure coherent
  with a graph skeleton. The model\r we propose tackles the problem of generating
  the\r data features constrained by the specific graph\r structure of each data point
  by splitting the task\r into two phases. In the first it models the\r distribution
  of features associated with the nodes\r of the given graph, in the second it complements
  the\r edge features conditionally on the node features. We\r follow the strategy
  of implicit distribution\r modelling via generative adversarial network (GAN)\r
  combined with permutation equivariant message\r passing architecture operating over
  the sets of\r nodes and edges. This enables generating the feature\r vectors of
  all the graph objects in one go (in 2\r phases) as opposed to a much slower one-by-one\r
  generations of sequential models, prevents the need\r for expensive graph matching
  procedures usually\r needed for likelihood-based generative models, and\r uses efficiently
  the network capacity by being\r insensitive to the particular node ordering in the\r
  graph representation. To the best of our knowledge,\r this is the first method that
  models the feature\r distribution along the graph skeleton allowing for\r generations
  of annotated graphs with user specified\r structures. Our experiments demonstrate
  the ability\r of our model to learn complex structured\r distributions through quantitative
  evaluation over\r three annotated graph datasets."
