title: "Adversarial Laser Spot: Robust and Covert\r Physical-World Attack to DNNs"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "Most existing deep neural networks (DNNs) are easily\r disturbed by slight
  noise. However, there are few\r researches on physical attacks by deploying lighting\r
  equipment. The light-based physical attacks has\r excellent covertness, which brings
  great security\r risks to many vision-based applications (such as\r self-driving).
  Therefore, we propose a light-based\r physical attack, called adversarial laser
  spot\r (AdvLS), which optimizes the physical parameters of\r laser spots through
  genetic algorithm to perform\r physical attacks. It realizes robust and covert\r
  physical attack by using low-cost laser\r equipment. As far as we know, AdvLS is
  the first\r light-based physical attack that perform physical\r attacks in the daytime.
  A large number of\r experiments in the digital and physical environments\r show
  that AdvLS has excellent robustness and\r covertness. In addition, through in-depth
  analysis\r of the experimental data, we find that the\r adversarial perturbations
  generated by AdvLS have\r superior adversarial attack migration. The\r experimental
  results show that AdvLS impose serious\r interference to advanced DNNs, we call
  for the\r attention of the proposed AdvLS."
