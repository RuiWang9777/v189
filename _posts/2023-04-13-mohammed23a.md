title: "Bootstrapping a high quality multilingual multimodal\r dataset for Bletchley"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "Vision-language models have recently made impressive\r strides, primarily
  driven by large-scale training on\r web data. While pioneering works such as CLIP
  and\r ALIGN show significant improvements, these are\r focused on English data as
  it is easy to source them\r from the web. Towards serving non-English-speaking\r
  demographics, we consider various methods for\r generating multilingual data and
  find that a simple\r bootstrapping mechanism works surprisingly\r well. Specifically,
  just using English image\r captions data and text-only multilingual translation\r
  pairs we train a fairly strong multilingual\r vision-language model and then leverage
  it to create\r a much cleaner version of the multilingual image\r captions dataset
  we collected. We demonstrate that\r this dataset which was used to train Bletchley\r
  result in a strong multi-modal and multilingual\r model which reaches strong performance
  across\r several multilingual zero-shot tasks. Specifically,\r Bletchley achieves
  state-of-the-art results on\r multilingual COCO, Multi30k sets, IGLUE WIT and\r
  xFlickr&CO datasets."
