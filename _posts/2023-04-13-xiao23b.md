title: "Probabilistic Fusion of Neural Networks that\r Incorporates Global Information"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "As one of the approaches in Federated Learning,\r model fusion distills
  models trained on local\r clients into a global model.  The previous method,\r Probabilistic
  Federated Neural Matching (PFNM), can\r match and fuse local neural networks with
  varying\r global model sizes and data heterogeneity using the\r Bayesian nonparametric
  framework. However, the\r alternating optimization process applied by PFNM\r causes
  absence of global neuron information. In this\r paper, we propose a new method that
  extends PFNM by\r introducing a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence\r penalty, so that
  it can exploit information in both\r local and global neurons. We show theoretically
  that\r the extended PFNM with a penalty derived from KL\r divergence can fix the
  drawback of PFNM by making a\r balance between Euclidean distance and the prior\r
  probability of neurons. Experiments on deep\r fully-connected as well as deep convolutional
  neural\r networks demonstrate that our new method outperforms\r popular state-of-the-art
  federated learning methods\r in both image classification and semantic\r segmentation
  tasks."
