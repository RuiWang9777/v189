title: "On the Convergence of Decentralized Adaptive\r Gradient Methods"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "Adaptive gradient methods including Adam, AdaGrad,\r and their variants
  have been very successful for\r training deep learning models, such as neural\r
  networks. Meanwhile, given the need for distributed\r computing, distributed optimization
  algorithms are\r rapidly becoming a focal point. With the growth of\r computing
  power and the need for using machine\r learning models on mobile devices, the communication\r
  cost of distributed training algorithms needs\r careful consideration. In this paper,
  we introduce\r novel convergent decentralized adaptive gradient\r methods and rigorously
  incorporate adaptive gradient\r methods into decentralized training\r procedures.
  Specifically, we propose a general\r algorithmic framework that can convert existing\r
  adaptive gradient methods to their decentralized\r counterparts. In addition, we
  thoroughly analyze the\r convergence behavior of the proposed algorithmic\r framework
  and show that if a given adaptive gradient\r method converges, under some specific
  conditions,\r then its decentralized counterpart is also\r convergent. We illustrate
  the benefit of our generic\r decentralized framework on prototype methods,\r AMSGrad
  and AdaGrad."
