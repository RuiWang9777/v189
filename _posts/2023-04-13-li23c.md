title: Robust Direct Learning for Causal Data Fusion
crossref: acml22
abstract: "In the era of big data, the explosive growth of\r multi-source heterogeneous
  data offers many exciting\r challenges and opportunities for improving the\r inference
  of conditional average treatment\r effects. In this paper, we investigate homogeneous\r
  and heterogeneous causal data fusion problems under\r a general setting that allows
  for the presence of\r source-specific covariates. We provide a direct\r learning
  framework for integrating multi-source data\r that separates the treatment effect
  from other\r nuisance functions, and achieves double robustness\r against certain
  misspecification. To improve\r estimation precision and stability, we propose a\r
  causal information-aware weighting function\r motivated by theoretical insights
  from the\r semiparametric efficiency theory; it assigns larger\r weights to samples
  containing more causal\r information with high interpretability. We introduce\r
  a two-step algorithm, the weighted multi-source\r direct learner, based on constructing
  a\r pseudo-outcome and regressing it on covariates under\r a weighted least square
  criterion; it offers us a\r powerful tool for causal data fusion, enjoying the\r
  advantages of easy implementation, double robustness\r and model flexibility. In
  simulation studies, we\r demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed\r methods
  in both homogeneous and heterogeneous causal\r data fusion scenarios."
