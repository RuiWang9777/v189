title: "Interpretable Representation Learning from Temporal\r Multi-view Data"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "In many scientific problems such as video\r surveillance, modern genomics,
  and finance, data are\r often collected from diverse measurements across\r time
  that exhibit time-dependent heterogeneous\r properties. Thus, it is important to
  not only\r integrate data from multiple sources (called\r multi-view data), but
  also to incorporate time\r dependency for deep understanding of the underlying\r
  system. We propose a generative model based on\r variational autoencoder and a recurrent
  neural\r network to infer the latent dynamics for multi-view\r temporal data.  This
  approach allows us to identify\r the disentangled latent embeddings across views\r
  while accounting for the time factor. We invoke our\r proposed model for analyzing
  three datasets on which\r we demonstrate the effectiveness and the\r interpretability
  of the model."
