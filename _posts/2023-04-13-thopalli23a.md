title: Domain Alignment Meets Fully Test-Time Adaptation
crossref: acml22
abstract: "A foundational requirement of a deployed ML model is\r to generalize to
  data drawn from a testing\r distribution that is different from training. A\r popular
  solution to this problem is to adapt a\r pre-trained model to novel domains using
  only\r unlabeled data. In this paper, we focus on a\r challenging variant of this
  problem, where access to\r the original source data is restricted. While fully\r
  test-time adaptation (FTTA) and unsupervised domain\r adaptation (UDA) are closely
  related, the advances\r in UDA are not readily applicable to TTA, since most\r UDA
  methods require access to the source\r data. Hence, we propose a new approach, CATTAn,
  that\r bridges UDA and FTTA, by relaxing the need to access\r entire source data,
  through a novel deep subspace\r alignment strategy. With a minimal overhead of\r
  storing the subspace basis set for the source data,\r CATTAn enables unsupervised
  alignment between source\r and target data during adaptation. Through extensive\r
  experimental evaluation on multiple 2D and 3D vision\r benchmar ks (ImageNet-C,
  Office-31, OfficeHome,\r DomainNet, PointDA-10) and model architectures, we\r demonstrate
  significant gains in FTTA\r performance. Furthermore, we make a number of\r crucial
  findings on the utility of the alignment\r objective even with inherently robust
  models,\r pre-trained ViT representations and under low sample\r availability in
  the target domain."
