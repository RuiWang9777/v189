title: "A two-stream convolution architecture for ESC based\r on audio feature distanglement"
crossref: acml22
abstract: " ESC (Environmental Sound Classification) is an\r active area of research
  in the field of audio\r classification that has made significant progress in\r recent
  years. The current mainstream ESC methods are\r based on increasing the dimension
  of the extracted\r audio features and therefore draw on the\r two-dimensional convolution
  methods used in image\r processing. However, two-dimensional convolution is\r expensive
  to train and the complexity of the\r corresponding model is usually very high. In\r
  response to these issues, we propose a novel\r two-stream neural network model by
  the idea of\r disentanglement, which uses onedimensional\r convolution for feature
  extraction to disentangle\r the audio features into the time and frequency\r domains
  separately. Our approach balances\r computational pressure with classification accuracy\r
  well. The accuracy of our approach on the Urbansound\r 8k and Esc-10 datasets was
  98.51% and 97.50%,\r respectively, which exceeds that of most\r models. Meanwhile,
  the model complexity is also\r lower."
