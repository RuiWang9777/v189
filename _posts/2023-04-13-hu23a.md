title: "Learning Practical Communication Strategies in\r Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement
  Learning"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "In Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, communication\r is critical to encourage
  cooperation among\r agents. Communication in realistic wireless networks\r can be
  highly unreliable due to network conditions\r varying with agentsâ€™ mobility, and
  stochasticity in\r the transmission process. We propose a framework to\r learn practical
  communication strategies by\r addressing three fundamental questions: (1)\r \\emph{When}:
  Agents learn the timing of\r communication based on not only message importance\r
  but also wireless channel conditions. (2)\r \\emph{What}: Agents augment message
  contents with\r wireless network measurements to better select the\r game and communication
  actions. (3) \\emph{How}:\r Agents use a novel neural message encoder to\r preserve
  all information from received messages,\r regardless of the number and order of\r
  messages. Simulating standard benchmarks under\r realistic wireless network settings,
  we show\r significant improvements in game performance,\r convergence speed and
  communication efficiency\r compared with state-of-the-art."
