title: "AS-IntroVAE: Adversarial Similarity Distance Makes\r Robust IntroVAE"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "Recently, introspective models like IntroVAE and\r S-IntroVAE have excelled
  in image generation and\r reconstruction tasks. The principal characteristic\r of
  introspective models is the adversarial learning\r of VAE, where the encoder attempts
  to distinguish\r between the real and the fake (i.e., synthesized)\r images. However,
  due to the unavailability of an\r effective metric to evaluate the difference between\r
  the real and the fake images, the posterior collapse\r and the vanishing gradient
  problem still exist,\r reducing the fidelity of the synthesized images. In\r this
  paper, we propose a new variation of IntroVAE\r called Adversarial Similarity Distance
  Introspective\r Variational Autoencoder (AS-IntroVAE). We\r theoretically analyze
  the vanishing gradient problem\r and construct a new Adversarial Similarity Distance\r
  (AS-Distance) using the 2-Wasserstein distance and\r the kernel trick. With weight
  annealing on\r AS-Distance and KL-Divergence, the AS-IntroVAE are\r able to generate
  stable and high-quality images. The\r posterior collapse problem is addressed by
  making\r per-batch attempts to transform the image so that it\r better fits the
  prior distribution in the latent\r space. Compared with the per-image approach,
  this\r strategy fosters more diverse distributions in the\r latent space, allowing
  our model to produce images\r of great diversity. Comprehensive experiments on\r
  benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of\r AS-IntroVAE on image generation
  and reconstruction\r tasks."
