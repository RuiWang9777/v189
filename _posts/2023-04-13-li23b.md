title: "Probabilistic Adaptive Spatial-Temporal Regularized\r Correlation Filters
  for UAV Tracking"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "Most existing trackers based on spatial-temporal\r regularized correlation
  filters exploit response map\r variation to adapt regularization terms to object\r
  appearance changes automatically. However, these\r trackers ignore the high uncertainty
  of the response\r map when the object is occluded or similar objects\r around, making
  them unable to learn reliable filters\r accurately. Furthermore, most correlation
  filters\r use linear interpolation directly to update the\r filter model at each
  frame, which may cause model\r degradation once the tracking result is inaccurate\r
  or missing. In this work, we propose a novel\r probabilistic adaptive spatial-temporal
  regularized\r correlation filters (PASTRCF) to solve the two\r issues mentioned
  above. A probabilistic model\r constructing the reliability of the response map
  is\r introduced to accurately utilize the information in\r the response map to learn
  regularization\r coefficients adaptively. The adaptive threshold\r mechanism provides
  an appropriate strategy to update\r the filter model to alleviate model\r degradation.
  Extensive experiments on UAV benchmarks\r have proven the favorable performance
  of our method\r compared to the state-of-art trackers, with robust\r tracking while
  ensuring real-time performance."
