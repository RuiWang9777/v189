title: "ProtoBandit: Efficient Prototype Selection via\r Multi-Armed Bandits"
crossref: acml22
year: '2022'
abstract: "In this work, we propose a multi-armed bandit based\r framework for identifying
  a compact set of\r informative data instances (i.e., the prototypes)\r that best
  represents a given target\r set. Prototypical examples of a given dataset offer\r
  interpretable insights into the underlying data\r distribution and assist in example-based
  reasoning,\r thereby influencing every sphere of human decision\r making. A key
  challenge is the large-scale setting,\r in which similarity comparison between pairs
  of data\r points needs to be done for almost all possible\r pairs. We propose to
  overcome this limitation by\r employing stochastic greedy search on the space of\r
  prototypical examples and multi-armed bandit\r approach for reducing the number
  of similarity\r comparisons. A salient feature of the proposed\r approach is that
  the total number of similarity\r comparisons needed is independent of the size of
  the\r target set. Empirically, we observe that our\r proposed approach, ProtoBandit,
  reduces the total\r number of similarity computation calls by several\r orders of
  magnitudes (100-1000 times) while\r obtaining solutions similar in quality to those
  from\r existing state-of-the-art approaches."
