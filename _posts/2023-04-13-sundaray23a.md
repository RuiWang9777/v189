abstract: "With the Internet of Everything (IoE) nowadays,\r monitoring edge systems
  is essential for\r coordinating everything into an IoE web. However, it\r is hard
  to monitor edge systems due to limited\r system information and limited sensors.
  To infer\r system information and provide robust monitoring\r capability, machine
  learning models were used to\r approximate mapping rules between different\r measurements.
  However, mapping rule learning using\r traditional machine learning tools is one
  way only,\r e.g., from measurement variables to the state vector\r variables. And,
  it is hard to be reverted, leading\r to over-fitting because of inconsistency between
  the\r forward and inverse learnings. Hence, we propose a\r structural deep neural
  network framework to provide\r a coherent two-way functional approximation. For\r
  physical regularization, we embed network size into\r the number of variables in
  the latent layers. We\r also utilize state sensors in the ‘latent layer’ to\r guide
  other latent variables to create state\r sets. The performance of reconstruction
  for the\r two-way mapping rule is validated extensively using\r test cases in the
  engineering, physics, and\r mathematical analysis domain."
