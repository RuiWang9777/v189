title: "Multi-class Classification from Multiple Unlabeled\r Datasets with Partial
  Risk Regularization"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "Recent years have witnessed a great success of\r supervised deep learning,
  where predictive models\r were trained from a large amount of fully labeled\r data.
  However, in practice, labeling such big data\r can be very costly and may not even
  be possible for\r privacy reasons. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to\r learn an
  accurate classifier without any class\r labels. More specifically, we consider the
  case\r where multiple sets of unlabeled data and only their\r class priors, i.e.,
  the proportions of each class,\r are available. Under this problem setup, we first\r
  derive an unbiased estimator of the classification\r risk that can be estimated
  from the given unlabeled\r sets and theoretically analyze the generalization\r error
  of the learned classifier. We then find that\r the classifier obtained as such tends
  to cause\r overfitting as its empirical risks go negative\r during training. To
  prevent overfitting, we further\r propose a partial risk regularization that maintains\r
  the partial risks with respect to unlabeled datasets\r and classes to certain levels.
  Experiments\r demonstrate that our method effectively mitigates\r overfitting and
  outperforms state-of-the-art methods\r for learning from multiple unlabeled sets."
