abstract: "In the real-world, most images are saved in JPEG\r format, so many forged
  images are partially or\r totally composed of JPEG images and then saved in\r JPEG
  format again. In this case, exposing forged\r images can be accomplished by the
  detection of\r double JPEG compressions. Although the detection\r methods of double
  JPEG compressions have greatly\r improved, they rely on handcrafted features of
  image\r patches and cannot locate forgery at pixel-level. To\r break this limitation,
  we propose an end-to-end\r feature-fusion network (FF-Net) for double\r compression
  detection and forgery localization. We\r find that JPEG compression fingerprint
  primarily\r exists on the high-frequency component of an image,\r and the singly
  and doubly compression yield\r different fingerprints. Therefore, we design two\r
  encoders cooperatively to learn the compression\r fingerprint directly from the
  whole image. A decoder\r is deployed to locate the regions with different\r compression
  fingerprints at pixel-level based on the\r learned compression fingerprint. The
  experiment\r results verify that the proposed FF-Net can detect\r and locate the
  forged regions more accurately than\r these existing detection methods. Besides,
  it has a\r good generalization ability that the network trained\r on one compression
  case can work in numerous\r compression cases. Moreover, it can detect different\r
  local forgeries, including copy-move, splicing, and\r object-removal."
