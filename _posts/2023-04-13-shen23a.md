title: "Temporal aware Multi-Interest Graph Neural Network\r for Session-based Recommendation"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "Session-based recommendation (SBR) is a challenging\r task, which aims
  at recommending next items based on\r anonymous interaction sequences. Despite the\r
  superior performance of existing methods for SBR,\r there are still several limitations:
  (i) Almost all\r existing works concentrate on single interest\r extraction and
  fail to disentangle multiple\r interests of user, which easily results in\r suboptimal
  representations for SBR. (ii)\r Furthermore, previous methods also ignore the\r
  multi-form temporal information, which is\r significant signal to obtain current
  intention for\r SBR. To address the limitations mentioned above, we\r propose a
  novel method, called Temporal aware\r Multi-Interest Graph Neural Network (TMI-GNN)
  to\r disentangle multi-interest and yield refined\r intention representations with
  the injection of two\r level temporal information. Specifically, by\r appending
  multiple interest nodes, we construct a\r multi-interest graph for current session,
  and adopt\r the GNNs to model the item-item relation to capture\r adjacent item
  transitions, item-interest relation to\r disentangle the multi-interests, and interest-item\r
  relation to refine the item\r representation. Meanwhile, we incorporate item-level\r
  time interval signals to guide the item information\r propagation, and interest-level
  time distribution\r information to assist the scattering of interest\r information.
  Experiments on three benchmark datasets\r demonstrate that TMI-GNN outperforms other\r
  state-of-the-art methods consistently."
