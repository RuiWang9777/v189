title: "FLVoogd: Robust And Privacy Preserving Federated\r Learning"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "In this work, we propose FLVoogd, an updated\r federated learning method
  in which servers and\r clients collaboratively eliminate Byzantine attacks\r while
  preserving privacy. In particular, servers use\r automatic Density-based Spatial
  Clustering of\r Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) combined with\r Secure Multi-party
  Computation (SMPC) to cluster the\r benign majority without acquiring sensitive
  personal\r information. Meanwhile, clients build dual models\r and perform test-based
  distance controlling to\r adjust their local models toward the global one to\r achieve
  personalizing.  Our framework is automatic\r and adaptive that servers/clients don’t
  need to tune\r the parameters during the training. In addition, our\r framework
  leverages SMPC’s operations, including\r multiplications, additions, and comparisons,
  where\r costly operations, like division and square root,\r are not required. Evaluations
  are carried out on\r some conventional datasets from the image\r classification
  field. The result shows that FLVoogd\r can effectively reject malicious uploads
  in most\r scenarios; meanwhile, it avoids data leakage from\r the server side."
