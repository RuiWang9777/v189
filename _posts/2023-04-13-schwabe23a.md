title: "AFRNN: Stable RNN with Top Down Feedback and\r Antisymmetry"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "Recurrent Neural Networks are an integral part of\r modern machine learning.
  They are good at performing\r tasks on sequential data. However, long sequences\r
  are still a problem for those models due to the\r well-known exploding/vanishing
  gradient problem. In\r this work, we build on recent approaches to\r interpreting
  the gradient problem as instability of\r the underlying dynamical system. We extend
  previous\r approaches to systems with top-down feedback, which\r is abundant in
  biological neural networks. We prove\r that the resulting system is stable for arbitrary\r
  depth and width and confirm this empirically. We\r further show that its performance
  is on par with\r LSTM and related approaches on standard benchmarks."
