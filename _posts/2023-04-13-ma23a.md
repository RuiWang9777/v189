title: "Learning Disentangled Representation in Pruning for\r Real-Time UAV Tracking"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "Efficiency is a critical issue in UAV tracking\r because of the limitations
  of computing resources,\r battery capacity, and maximum load of unmanned\r aerial
  vehicle (UAV). However, deep learning\r (DL)-based trackers hardly achieve real-time\r
  tracking on a single CPU despite their high tracking\r precision. To the contrary,
  discriminative\r correlation filters (DCF)-based trackers have high\r efficiency
  but their precision is barely\r satisfactory. Despite the precision is inferior,\r
  DCF-based trackers instead of DL-based ones are\r widely applied in UAV tracking
  to trade precision\r for efficiency. This paper aims to improve the\r efficiency
  of the DL-based tracker SiamFC++, in\r particular, for UAV tracking using the model\r
  compression technique, i.e., rank-based filter\r pruning, which has not been well
  explored\r before. Meanwhile, to combat the potential loss of\r precision caused
  by pruning we exploit disentangled\r representation learning to disentangle the
  output\r feature of the backbone into two parts: the\r identity-related features
  and the identity-unrelated\r features. Only the identity-related features are\r
  used for subsequent classification and regression\r tasks to improve the effectiveness
  of the feature\r representation. With the proposed disentangled\r representation
  in pruning, we achieved higher\r precisions when compressing the original model\r
  SiamFC++ with a global pruning ratio of\r 0.5. Extensive experiments on four public
  UAV\r benchmarks, i.e., UAV123@10fps, UAVDT, DTB70, and\r Vistrone2018, show that
  the proposed tracker\r DP-SiamFC++ strikes a remarkable balance between\r efficiency
  and precision, and achieves\r state-of-the-art performance in UAV tracking."
