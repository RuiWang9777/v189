title: "Trusted Loss Correction for Noisy Multi-Label\r Learning"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "Noisy and corrupted labels are shown to\r significantly undermine the performance
  of\r multi-label learning, which has multiple labels in\r each image. Correcting
  the loss via a label\r corruption matrix is effective in improving the\r robustness
  of single-label classification against\r noisy labels. However, estimating the corruption\r
  matrix for multi-label problems is no mean feat due\r to the unbalanced distributions
  of labels and the\r presence of multiple objects that may be mapped into\r the same
  labels. In this paper, we propose a robust\r multi-label classifier against label
  noise, TLCM,\r which corrects the loss based on a corruption matrix\r estimated
  on trusted data. To overcome the challenge\r of unbalanced label distribution and
  multi-object\r mapping, we use trusted single-label data as\r regulators to correct
  the multi-label corruption\r matrix. Empirical evaluation on real-world vision\r
  and object detection datasets, i.e., MS-COCO,\r NUS-WIDE, and MIRFLICKR, shows that
  our method under\r medium (30%) and high (60%) corruption levels\r outperforms state-of-the-art
  multi-label classifier\r (ASL) and noise-resilient multi-label classifier\r (MPVAE),
  by on average 12.5% and 26.3% mean average\r precision (mAP) points, respectively."
