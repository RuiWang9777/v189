title: "Bayesian Change-Point Detection for Bandit Feedback\r in Non-stationary Environments"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "The stochastic multi-armed bandit problem has been\r widely studied under
  the stationary\r assumption. However in real world problems and\r industrial applications,
  this assumption is often\r unrealistic because the distributions of rewards may\r
  change over time. In this paper, we consider the\r piece-wise iid non-stationary
  stochastic multi-armed\r bandit problem with unknown change-points and we\r focus
  on the change of mean setup. To solve the\r latter, we propose a change-point based
  framework\r where we study a class of change-detection based\r optimal bandit policies
  that actively detects\r change-point using the restarted Bayesian online\r change-point
  detector and then restarts the bandit\r indices. Analytically, in the context of
  regret\r minimization, our proposal achieves a\r $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{A T K_T })$
  regret upper-bound\r where $K_T$ is the overall number of change-points\r up to
  the horizon $T$ and $A$ is the number of\r arms. The derived bound matches the existing
  lower\r bound for abruptly changing environments. Finally,\r we demonstrate the
  cumulative regret reduction of\r the our proposal over synthetic Bernoulli rewards
  as\r well as Yahoo! datasets of webpage click-through\r rates."
