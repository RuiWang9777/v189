title: "Constrained Density Matching and Modeling for\r Cross-lingual Alignment of
  Contextualized\r Representations"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "Multilingual representations pre-trained with\r monolingual data exhibit
  considerably unequal task\r performances across languages. Previous studies\r address
  this challenge with resource-intensive\r contextualized alignment, which assumes
  the\r availability of large parallel data, thereby leaving\r under-represented language
  communities behind. In\r this work, we attribute the data hungriness of\r previous
  alignment techniques to two limitations:\r (i) the inability to sufficiently leverage
  data and\r (ii) these techniques are not trained properly. To\r address these issues,
  we introduce supervised and\r unsupervised density-based approaches named Real-NVP\r
  and GAN-Real-NVP, driven by Normalizing Flow, to\r perform alignment, both dissecting
  the alignment of\r multilingual subspaces into density matching and\r density modeling.
  We complement these approaches\r with our validation criteria in order to guide
  the\r training process. Our experiments encompass 16\r alignments, including our
  approaches, evaluated\r across 6 language pairs, synthetic data and 5 NLP\r tasks.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our\r approaches in the scenarios of limited
  and no\r parallel data. First, our supervised approach\r trained on 20k parallel
  data (sentences) mostly\r surpasses Joint-Align and InfoXLM trained on over\r 100k
  parallel sentences. Second, parallel data can\r be removed without sacrificing performance
  when\r integrating our unsupervised approach in our\r bootstrapping procedure, which
  is theoretically\r motivated to enforce equality of multilingual\r subspaces. Moreover,
  we demonstrate the advantages\r of validation criteria over validation data for\r
  guiding supervised training."
