title: "Balanced Spatial-Temporal Graph Structure Learning\r for Multivariate Time
  Series Forecasting: A\r Trade-off between Efficiency and Flexibility"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "Accurate forecasting of multivariate time series is\r an extensively studied
  subject in finance,\r transportation, and computer science. Fully mining\r the correlation
  and causation between the variables\r in a multivariate time series exhibits noticeable\r
  results in improving the performance of a time\r series model. Recently, some models
  have explored\r the dependencies between variables through\r end-to-end graph structure
  learning without the need\r for predefined graphs. However, current models do\r
  not incorporate the trade-off between efficiency and\r flexibility and make insufficient
  use of the\r information contained in time series in the design\r of graph structure
  learning algorithms. This paper\r alleviates the above issues by proposing Balanced\r
  Graph Structure Learning for Forecasting (BGSLF), a\r novel and effective deep learning
  model that joins\r graph structure learning and\r forecasting. Technically, BGSLF
  leverages the\r spatial information into convolutional operations\r and extracts
  temporal dynamics using the diffusion\r convolutional recurrent network. The proposed\r
  framework emphasizes the trade-off between\r efficiency and flexibility by introducing\r
  Multi-Graph Generation Network (MGN) and Graph\r Selection Module. In addition,
  a method named Smooth\r Sparse Unit (SSU) is designed to sparse the learned\r graph
  structures, which conforms to the sparse\r spatial correlations in the real world.
  Extensive\r experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate\r that our model
  achieves state-of-the-art\r performances with minor trainable parameters. Our\r
  code is publicly available at\r https://github.com/onceCWJ/BGSLF."
