title: "Learning with Interactive Models over\r Decision-Dependent Distributions"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "Classical supervised learning generally trains one\r model from an i.i.d.
  data according to an unknown\r yet fixed distribution. In some real applications\r
  such as finance, however, multiple models may be\r trained by different companies
  and interacted in a\r dynamic environment, where the data distribution may\r take
  shift according to different modelsâ€™\r decisions. In this work, we study two models
  for\r simplicity, and formalize such scenario as a\r learning problem of two models
  over\r decision-dependent distributions. We develop the\r Repeated Risk Minimization
  (RRM) for two models, and\r present a sufficient condition to the existence of\r
  stable points for RRM, that is, an equilibrium\r notion. We further provide the
  theoretical analysis\r for the convergence of RRM to stable points based on\r data
  distribution and finite training sample,\r respectively. We also study more practical\r
  algorithms, such as gradient descent and stochastic\r gradient descent, to solve
  the RRM problem with\r convergence guarantees and we finally present some\r empirical
  studies to validate our theoretical\r analysis."
