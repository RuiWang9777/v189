title: "Embedding Adaptation Network with Transformer for\r Few-Shot Action Recognition"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "Few-shot action recognition aims to classify novel\r action categories
  using a few training samples. Most\r current few-shot action recognition methods
  via\r episodic training strategy mainly use the same\r normalization method to normalize
  feature\r embeddings, leading to limited performance when the\r batch size is small.
  And some methods learn feature\r embeddings individually without considering the\r
  whole task, neglecting important interactive\r information between videos in the
  current\r episode. To address these problems, we propose a\r novel embedding adaptation
  network with Transformer\r (EANT) for few-shot action\r recognition. Specifically,
  we first propose an\r improved self-guided instance normalization (SGIN)\r module
  to adaptively learn class-specific feature\r embeddings in an input-dependent manner.
  Built upon\r the learned feature embeddings, we design a\r Transformer-based embedding
  learning (TEL) module to\r learn task-specific feature embeddings by fully\r capturing
  rich information cross videos in each\r episodic task. Furthermore, we utilize semantic\r
  knowledge among all sampled training classes as\r additional supervisory information
  to improve the\r generalization ability of the network. By this\r means, the proposed
  EANT can be highly effective and\r informative for few-shot action\r recognition.
  Extensive experiments conducted on\r several challenging few-shot action recognition\r
  benchmarks show that the proposed EANT outperforms\r several state-of-the-art methods
  by a large margin."
