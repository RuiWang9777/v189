title: "EENAS: An Eﬀicient Evolutionary Algorithm for Neural\r Architecture Search"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has been widely\r applied to automatic
  neural architecture\r design. Traditional NAS methods often evaluate a\r large number
  of architectures, leading to expensive\r computation overhead.  To speed-up architecture\r
  search, recent NAS methods try to employ network\r estimation strategies for guidance
  of promising\r architecture selection.  In this paper, we have\r proposed an efficient
  evolutionary algorithm for\r NAS, which adapts the most advanced proxy of\r synthetic
  signal bases for architecture\r estimation. Extensive experiments show that our\r
  method outperforms state-of-the-art NAS methods, on\r NAS-Bench-101 search space
  and NAS-Bench-201 search\r space (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and\r ImageNet16-120). Compared
  with existing works, our\r method could identify better architectures with\r greatly
  reduced search time."
