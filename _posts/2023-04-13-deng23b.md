title: "BayesAdapter: Being Bayesian, Inexpensively and\r Reliably, via Bayesian Fine-tuning"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "Despite their theoretical appealingness, Bayesian\r neural networks (BNNs)
  are left behind in real-world\r adoption, mainly due to persistent concerns on their\r
  scalability, accessibility, and reliability. In this\r work, we develop the BayesAdapter
  framework to\r relieve these concerns. In particular, we propose to\r adapt pre-trained
  deterministic NNs to be\r variational BNNs via cost-effective Bayesian\r fine-tuning.
  Technically, we develop a modularized\r implementation for the learning of variational
  BNNs,\r and refurbish the generally applicable exemplar\r reparameterization trick
  through exemplar\r parallelization to efficiently reduce the gradient\r variance
  in stochastic variational inference. Based\r on the the lightweight Bayesian learning
  paradigm,\r we conduct extensive experiments on a variety of\r benchmarks, and show
  that our method can\r consistently induce posteriors with higher quality\r than
  competitive baselines, yet significantly\r reducing training overheads."
