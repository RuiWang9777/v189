title: "On PAC Learning Halfspaces in Non-interactive Local\r Privacy Model with Public
  Unlabeled Data"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "In this paper, we study the problem of PAC learning\r halfspaces in the
  non-interactive local differential\r privacy model (NLDP).  To breach the barrier
  of\r exponential sample complexity, previous results\r studied a relaxed setting
  where the server has\r access to some additional public but unlabeled\r data. We
  continue in this direction. Specifically,\r we consider the problem under the standard
  setting\r instead of the large margin setting studied\r before. Under different
  mild assumptions on the\r underlying data distribution, we propose two\r approaches
  that are based on the Massart noise model\r and self-supervised learning and show
  that it is\r possible to achieve sample complexities that are\r only linear in the
  dimension and polynomial in other\r terms for both private and public data, which\r
  significantly improve the previous results. Our\r methods could also be used for
  other private PAC\r learning problems."
