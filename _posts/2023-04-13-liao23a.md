title: "Locally Differentially Private Reinforcement\r Learning for Linear Mixture
  Markov Decision\r Processes"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can be used\r to provide personalized
  services, which rely on\r users’ private and sensitive data. To protect the\r users’
  privacy, privacy-preserving RL algorithms are\r in demand. In this paper, we study
  RL with linear\r function approximation and local differential\r privacy (LDP) guarantees.
  We propose a novel\r $(\\varepsilon, \\delta)$-LDP algorithm for learning a\r class
  of Markov decision processes (MDPs) dubbed\r linear mixture MDPs, and obtains an\r
  $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\r d^{5/4}H^{7/4}T^{3/4}\\left(\\log(1/\\delta)\\right)^{1/4}\\sqrt{1/\\varepsilon})$\r
  regret, where $d$ is the dimension of feature\r mapping, $H$ is the length of the
  planning horizon,\r and $T$ is the number of interactions with the\r environment.
  \ We also prove a lower bound\r $\\Omega(dH\\sqrt{T}/\\left(e^{\\varepsilon}(e^{\\varepsilon}-1)\\right))$\r
  for learning linear mixture MDPs under\r $\\varepsilon$-LDP constraint. Experiments
  on\r synthetic datasets verify the effectiveness of our\r algorithm. To the best
  of our knowledge, this is the\r first provable privacy-preserving RL algorithm with\r
  linear function approximation."
