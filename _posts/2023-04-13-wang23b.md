title: "Margin Calibration for Long-Tailed Visual\r Recognition"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "Long-tailed visual recognition tasks pose great\r challenges for neural
  networks on how to handle the\r imbalanced predictions between head (common) and\r
  tail (rare) classes, i.e., models tend to classify\r tail classes as head classes.
  While existing\r research focused on data resampling and loss\r function engineering,
  in this paper, we take a\r different perspective: the classification\r margins.
  We study the relationship between the\r margins and logits and empirically observe
  that the\r uncalibrated margins and logits are positively\r correlated. We propose
  a simple yet effective MARgin\r Calibration approach (MARC) to calibrate the margins\r
  to obtain better logits. We validate MARC through\r extensive experiments on common
  long-tailed\r benchmarks including CIFAR-LT, ImageNet-LT,\r Places-LT, and iNaturalist-LT.
  Experimental results\r demonstrate that our MARC achieves favorable results\r on
  these benchmarks. In addition, MARC is extremely\r easy to implement with just three
  lines of code. We\r hope this simple approach will motivate people to\r rethink
  the uncalibrated margins and logits in\r long-tailed visual recognition."
