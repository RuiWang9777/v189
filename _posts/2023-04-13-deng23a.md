title: "A Self-improving Skin Lesions Diagnosis Framework\r Via Pseudo-labeling and
  Self-distillation"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "In the past few years, supervised-based deep\r learning methods has yielded
  good results in skin\r lesions diagnosis tasks. Unfortunately, obtaining\r large
  of labels for medical images is expensive and\r time consuming. In this paper, we
  propose a\r self-improving skin lesions diagnosis (SISLD)\r framework to explore
  useful information in unlabeled\r data. We first propose a semi-supervised model\r
  ${f}$, which combining consistency and\r class-balanced pseudo-labeling to make
  full use of\r unlabeled data in scenarios with sparse manually\r labeled samples,
  and obtain a teacher model\r ${f_{t}}$ by semi-supervised self-training. Then, we\r
  introduce self-distillation method to enable\r knowledge distillation for the diagnosis
  of skin\r lesions. Finally, we measure diagnostic\r effectiveness in the context
  of label sparsity and\r class imbalance. The experiments on skin lesion\r images
  dataset ISIC2018 shows that SISLD achieves\r significant improvements in AUC, Accuracy,\r
  Specificity and Sensitivity."
