title: "Contrastive Inductive Bias Controlling Networks for\r Reinforcement Learning"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "Effective learning in an visual-based environment is\r essential for reinforcement
  learning (RL) agent,\r while it has been empirically observed that learning\r from
  high dimensional observations such as raw\r pixels is sample-inefficient. For common
  practice,\r RL algorithms for image input often use encoders\r composed of CNNs
  to extract useful features from\r high dimensional observations. Recent studies
  have\r shown that CNNs have strong inductive bias towards\r image styles rather
  than content (i.e. agent\r shapes), while content is the information that RL\r algorithms
  should focus on. Inspired by this, we\r suggest reducing the intrinsic style bias
  of CNNs by\r proposing Contrastive Inductive Bias Controlling\r Networks for RL.
  It can help RL algorithms\r effectively focus on truly noteworthy information\r
  like agentsâ€™ own characteristics. Our approach\r incorporates two transfer networks
  and feature\r encoder with contrastive learning methods, guiding\r RL algorithms
  to learn more efficiently with\r sampling. Extensive experiments show that the\r
  extended framework greatly enhances the performance\r of existing model-free methods
  (i.e. SAC), enabling\r it to reach state-of-the-art performance on the\r DeepMind
  control suite benchmark."
