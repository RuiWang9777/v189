title: On the Episodic Difficulty of Few-shot Learning
crossref: acml22
abstract: "Dog vs. hot dog and dog vs. wolf, which one tends to\r be a harder comparison
  task? While simple, this\r question can be meaningful for few-shot\r classification.
  Few-shot learning enables trained\r models to recognize unseen classes through just
  a\r few labelled samples. As such, trained few-shot\r models usually have to possess
  the ability to assess\r the similarity degree between the unlabelled and\r labelled
  samples. In each few-shot learning episode,\r a combination of the labelled support
  set and\r unlabelled query set are sampled from the training\r dataset for model-training.
  In the episodic settings\r of few-shot learning, most algorithms draw the data\r
  samples uniformly at random for training. However,\r this approach disregards concepts
  of difficulty of\r each training episode, which may make a difference.\r After all,
  it is usually easier to differentiate\r between a dog and a hot dog, versus the
  dog and a\r wolf.  Therefore, in this paper, we delve into the\r concept of episodic
  difficulty, or difficulty of\r each training episode, discovering several insights\r
  and proposing strategies to utilize the difficulty.\r Firstly, defining episodic
  difficulty as a training\r loss, we find and study the correlation between\r episodic
  difficulty and visual similarity among data\r samples in each episode.  Secondly,
  we assess the\r respective usefulness of easy and difficult episodes\r for the training
  process.  Lastly, based on the\r assessment, we design a curriculum for few-shot\r
  learning to support training with incremental\r difficulty.  We observe that such
  an approach can\r achieve faster convergence for few-shot algorithms,\r reducing
  the average training time by around 50%.\r It can also make meta-learning algorithms
  achieve an\r increase in final testing accuracy scores."
