title: "Deep Reinforcement Learning for High-Frequency\r Market Making"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "High-frequency market making is a algorithmic\r trading strategy in which
  an agent provides\r liquidity at the same time as quoting a bid price\r and an ask
  price on a security. The strategy reap\r profits in the form of the spread between
  the quoted\r price placed on the buy and sell prices. Due to\r complexity in inventory
  risk, counterparties to\r trades and information asymmetry, the understanding\r
  of high-frequency market making algorithms is\r relatively unexplored by academics
  across\r disciplines. In this paper, we develop realistic\r simulations of limit
  order markets and use them to\r design a high-frequency market making agent using\r
  Deep Recurrent Q-Networks. Our approach outperforms\r a prominent benchmark strategy
  from literature,\r which uses temporal-difference reinforcement\r learning to design
  market making agents. Using the\r simulation framework, we analyse how the maker-take\r
  fee, a feature of market design, affects market\r quality and the agentâ€™s profitability.
  The agents\r successfully reproduce stylised facts in historical\r trade data from
  each simulation."
