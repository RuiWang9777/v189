title: "A Novel Graph Aggregation Method Based on Feature\r Distribution Around Each
  Ego-node for Heterophily"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "In this paper, we propose a novel graph aggregation\r method based on feature
  distribution around each\r ego-node (a node to which features are aggregated)\r
  for heterophily. In heterophily graphs, labels of\r neighboring nodes can be uniformly
  distributed. In\r such case, aggregated features by existing GNNs will\r be always
  similar regardless of the label of\r ego-node and fail to capture useful information
  for\r a node classification task. Since the existing\r methods basically ignore
  label distribution around\r the ego-node, we attempt to handle heterophily\r graphs
  through dynamic aggregations so that nodes\r with similar vicinity characteristics
  exhibit\r similar behavior. In particular, we adjust the\r amount of aggregation
  based on the features\r generated by higher-order neighbors, since they\r reflect
  the label distribution around each\r ego-node. By doing this, we can take the influence\r
  of distant nodes into account while adapting local\r structures of each node. Extensive
  experiments\r demonstrate that the proposed method achieves higher\r performance
  in heterophily graphs by up to 14.68%\r compared with existing methods."
