title: "BINAS: Bilinear Interpretable Neural Architecture\r Search"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "Realistic use of neural networks often requires\r adhering to multiple
  constraints on latency, energy\r and memory among others.  A popular approach to
  find\r fitting networks is through constrained Neural\r Architecture Search (NAS).
  However, previous methods\r use complicated predictors for the accuracy of the\r
  network.  Those predictors are hard to interpret and\r sensitive to many hyperparameters
  to be tuned,\r hence, the resulting accuracy of the generated\r models is often
  harmed.  In this work we resolve\r this by introducing Bilinear Interpretable Neural\r
  Architecture Search (BINAS), that is based on an\r accurate and simple bilinear
  formulation of both an\r accuracy estimator and the expected resource\r requirement,
  together with a scalable search method\r with theoretical guarantees. The simplicity
  of our\r proposed estimator together with the intuitive way\r it is constructed
  bring interpretability through\r many insights about the contribution of different\r
  design choices. For example, we find that in the\r examined search space, adding
  depth and width is\r more effective at deeper stages of the network and\r at the
  beginning of each resolution stage.  Our\r experiments show that BINAS generates
  comparable to\r or better architectures than other state-of-the-art\r NAS methods
  within a reduced search cost for each\r additional generated network, while strictly\r
  satisfying the resource constraints."
