title: "Feature Distribution Matching for Federated Domain\r Generalization"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "Multi-source domain adaptation has been intensively\r studied. The distribution
  shift in features inherent\r to specific domains causes the negative transfer\r
  problem, degrading a modelâ€™s generality to unseen\r tasks. In Federated Learning
  (FL), learned model\r parameters are shared to train a global model that\r leverages
  the underlying knowledge across client\r models trained on separate data\r domains.
  Nonetheless, the data confidentiality of FL\r hinders the effectiveness of traditional
  domain\r adaptation methods that require prior knowledge of\r different domain data.
  We propose a new federated\r domain generalization method called Federated\r Knowledge
  Alignment (FedKA). FedKA leverages feature\r distribution matching in a global workspace
  such\r that the global model can learn domain-invariant\r client features under
  the constraint of unknown\r client data. FedKA employs a federated voting\r mechanism
  that generates target domain pseudo-labels\r based on the consensus from clients
  to facilitate\r global model fine-tuning. We performed extensive\r experiments,
  including an ablation study, to\r evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method
  in\r both image and text classification tasks using\r different model architectures.
  The empirical results\r show that FedKA achieves performance gains of 8.8%\r and
  3.5% in Digit-Five and Office-Caltech10,\r respectively, and a gain of 0.7% in Amazon
  Review\r with extremely limited training data. Moreover, we\r studied the effectiveness
  of FedKA in alleviating\r the negative transfer of FL based on a new criterion\r
  called Group Effect. The results show that FedKA can\r reduce negative transfer,
  improving the performance\r gain via model aggregation by 4 times."
