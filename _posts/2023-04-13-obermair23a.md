title: "Example or Prototype? Learning Concept-Based\r Explanations in Time-Series"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "With the continuous increase of deep learning\r applications in safety
  critical systems, the need\r for an interpretable decision-making process has\r
  become a priority within the research\r community. While there are many existing
  explainable\r artificial intelligence algorithms, a systematic\r assessment of the
  suitability of global explanation\r methods for different applications is not\r
  available. In this paper, we respond to this demand\r by systematically comparing
  two existing global\r concept-based explanation methods with our proposed\r global,
  model-agnostic concept-based explanation\r method for time-series data. This method
  is based on\r an autoencoder structure and derives abstract global\r explanations
  called \"prototypes\". The results of a\r human user study and a quantitative analysis
  show a\r superior performance of the proposed method, but\r also highlight the necessity
  of tailoring\r explanation methods to the target audience of\r machine learning
  models."
