title: "DALE: Differential Accumulated Local Effects for\r efficient and accurate
  global explanations"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "Accumulated Local Effect (ALE) is a method for\r accurately estimating
  feature effects, overcoming\r fundamental failure modes of previously-existed\r
  methods, such as Partial Dependence Plots. However,\r \\textit{ALE’s approximation},
  i.e. the method for\r estimating ALE from the limited samples of the\r training
  set, faces two weaknesses. First, it does\r not scale well in cases where the input
  has high\r dimensionality, and, second, it is vulnerable to\r out-of-distribution
  (OOD) sampling when the training\r set is relatively small. In this paper, we propose
  a\r novel ALE approximation, called Differential\r Accumulated Local Effects (DALE),
  which can be used\r in cases where the ML model is differentiable and an\r auto-differentiable
  framework is accessible. Our\r proposal has significant computational advantages,\r
  making feature effect estimation applicable to\r high-dimensional Machine Learning
  scenarios with\r near-zero computational overhead. Furthermore, DALE\r does not
  create artificial points for calculating\r the feature effect, resolving misleading
  estimations\r due to OOD sampling. Finally, we formally prove\r that, under some
  hypotheses, DALE is an unbiased\r estimator of ALE and we present a method for\r
  quantifying the standard error of the\r explanation. Experiments using both synthetic
  and\r real datasets demonstrate the value of the proposed\r approach."
