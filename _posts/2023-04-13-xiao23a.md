title: Semantic Cross Attention for Few-shot Learning
crossref: acml22
abstract: "Few-shot learning (FSL) has attracted considerable\r attention recently.
  Among existing approaches, the\r metric-based method aims to train an embedding\r
  network that can make similar samples close while\r dissimilar samples as far as
  possible and achieves\r promising results. FSL is characterized by using\r only
  a few images to train a model that can\r generalize to novel classes in image classification\r
  problems, but this setting makes it difficult to\r learn the visual features that
  can identify the\r imagesâ€™ appearance variations. The model training is\r likely
  to move in the wrong direction, as the images\r in an identical semantic class may
  have dissimilar\r appearances, whereas the images in different\r semantic classes
  may share a similar appearance. We\r argue that FSL can benefit from additional
  semantic\r features to learn discriminative feature\r representations. Thus, this
  study proposes a\r multi-task learning approach to view semantic\r features of label
  text as an auxiliary task to help\r boost the performance of the FSL task. Our proposed\r
  model uses word-embedding representations as\r semantic features to help train the
  embedding\r network and a semantic cross-attention module to\r bridge the semantic
  features into the typical visual\r modal. The proposed approach is simple, but produces\r
  excellent results. We apply our proposed approach to\r two previous metric-based
  FSL methods, all of which\r can substantially improve performance. The source\r
  code for our model is accessible from github."
