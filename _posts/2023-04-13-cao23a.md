title: "Robust Scene Text Detection via Learnable Scene\r Transformations"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "Scene text detection based on deep neural networks\r has been extensively
  studied in the last few\r years. However, the task of detecting texts in\r complex
  scenes such as bad weather and image\r distortions has not received sufficient attentions\r
  in existing works, which is crucial for real-world\r applications such as text translation,
  autonomous\r driving, etc. In this paper, we propose a novel\r strategy to automatically
  search for the effective\r scene transformation polices to augment images in\r the
  training phase. In addition, we build a new\r dataset, Robust-Text, to evaluate
  the robustness of\r text detection methods in real complex\r scenes. Experiments
  conducted on the ICDAR2015,\r MSRA-TD500 and Robust-Text datasets demonstrate that\r
  our method can effectively improve the robustness of\r text detectors in complex
  scenes."
