title: "RoLNiP: Robust Learning Using Noisy Pairwise\r Comparisons"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "This paper presents a robust approach for learning\r from noisy pairwise
  comparisons. We propose\r sufficient conditions on the loss function under\r which
  the risk minimization frame- work becomes\r robust to noise in the pairwise similar
  dissimilar\r data. Our approach does not require the knowledge of\r noise rate in
  the uniform noise case. In the case of\r conditional noise, the proposed method
  depends on\r the noise rates. For such cases, we offer a provably\r correct approach
  for estimating the noise\r rates. Thus, we propose an end-to-end approach to\r learning
  robust classifiers in this setting. We\r experimentally show that the proposed approach\r
  RoLNiP outperforms the robust state-of-the-art\r methods for learning with noisy
  pairwise\r comparisons."
