  Multi Label Classification\r Approach"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "Myocardial Infarctions (MI) or heart attacks are\r among the most common
  medical emergencies\r globally. Such an episode often has mild or varied\r symptoms,
  making it hard to diagnose and respond in\r a timely manner. An electrocardiogram
  (ECG) is used\r to analyze the heartâ€™s electrical activity and,\r through this help,
  clinicians detect and localize a\r heart attack. However, interpretation of the
  ECG is\r made manually by trained professionals. In order to\r make this diagnosis
  more efficient, multiple methods\r have tried to automate the MI detection and\r
  localization process. In this work, we aim to create\r a more effective method of
  MI detection by\r restructuring the localization as a multi-label\r classification
  (MLC) problem, in which one set of\r attributes can belong to one or more classes.
  For\r this classification, features like the ST-deviation,\r T wave amplitude, and
  R-S ratios have been extracted\r and fed into the MLC model, which in our case,
  is a\r chain classifier of random forest. This proposed\r model will have five classes
  as the target, which\r represent the locations where an MI can occur. Our\r method
  achieves the best overall hamming accuracy of\r 81.49% in a k-fold cross validation
  test, with the\r highest accuracy for an individual class being\r 97.72% for anterior."
