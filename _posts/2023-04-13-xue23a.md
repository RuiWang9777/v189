title: "Cross-Scale Context Extracted Hashing for\r Fine-Grained Image Binary Encoding"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "Deep hashing has been widely applied to large-scale\r image retrieval tasks
  owing to efficient computation\r and low storage cost by encoding high-dimensional\r
  image data into binary codes. Since binary codes do\r not contain as much information
  as float features,\r the essence of binary encoding is preserving the\r main context
  to guarantee retrieval\r quality. However, the existing hashing methods have\r great
  limitations on suppressing redundant\r background information and accurately encoding
  from\r Euclidean space to Hamming space by a simple sign\r function. In order to
  solve these problems, a\r Cross-Scale Context Extracted Hashing Network\r (CSCE-Net)
  is proposed in this paper. Firstly, we\r design a two-branch framework to capture\r
  fine-grained local information while maintaining\r high-level global semantic information.
  Besides,\r Attention guided Information Extraction module (AIE)\r is introduced
  between two branches, which suppresses\r areas of low context information cooperated
  with\r global sliding windows. Unlike previous methods, our\r CSCE-Net learns a
  content-related Dynamic Sign\r Function (DSF) to replace the original simple sign\r
  function. Therefore, the proposed CSCE-Net is\r context-sensitive and able to perform
  well on\r accurate image binary encoding. We further\r demonstrate that our CSCE-Net
  is superior to the\r existing hashing methods, which improves retrieval\r performance
  on standard benchmarks."
