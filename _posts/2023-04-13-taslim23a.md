title: "Hashing2Vec: Fast Embedding Generation for\r SARS-CoV-2 Spike Sequence Classification"
crossref: acml22
abstract: " Due to the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic,\r an unprecedented
  amount of SARS-CoV-2 sequence data\r is available. The scale of this data has out-paced\r
  traditional methods for its analysis, while\r machine-learning approaches aimed
  at clustering and\r classification of SARS-CoV-2 variants is becoming an\r attractive
  alternative. Since the SARS-CoV-2 genome\r is highly dimensional, considering the
  much smaller\r spike region can save a great deal of processing.\r As the spike
  protein mediates the attachment of the\r coronavirus to the host cell, most of the
  newer and\r more contagious variants can be characterized by\r alterations to the
  spike protein; hence it is often\r sufficient for characterizing the different\r
  SARS-CoV-2 variants. Another important consideration\r is to have a fast feature
  embedding generation,\r which is the subject of this work.  Applying any\r machine
  learning (ML) model to a biological sequence\r requires first transforming it into
  a fixed-length\r (numerical) form. While there exist several compact\r embeddings
  for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequences,\r the generation process is computationally
  expensive\r since the features, added to the resulting vectors,\r are indexed in
  a na√Øve fashion.  To solve this\r problem, we propose a fast and alignment-free\r
  hashing-based approach to design a fixed-length\r feature embedding for spike protein
  sequences,\r called Hashing2Vec, which can be used as input to\r any standard ML
  model. Using real-world data, we\r show that the proposed embedding is not only\r
  efficient to compute but also outperforms current\r state-of-the-art embedding methods
  in terms of\r classification accuracy. In terms of runtime, we\r achieve up to a
  99.8% improvement in the\r Hashing2Vec-based embedding generation as compared\r
  to the baselines on a set of 7K spike amino acid\r sequences. It also outperforms
  the baselines on this\r data in terms of predictive performance and achieves\r accuracy
  and ROC-AUC scores of 86% and 84.4%,\r respectively."
