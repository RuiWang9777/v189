abstract: "In recent years, semantic segmentation has shown\r very good performance
  in daytime scenes. But in\r nighttime scenes, semantic segmentation greatly\r reduces
  its accuracy. Due to the lack of large-scale\r nighttime semantic segmentation datasets,
  it is\r difficult to directly train segmentation models for\r nighttime scenes.
  Therefore, it becomes important to\r adapt the daytime scene segmentation model
  to the\r nighttime scene without directly using the nighttime\r scene segmentation
  dataset. In this paper, we\r propose a framework based on unsupervised learning\r
  and cross attention. The proposed method fuses\r supervised daytime scenes and unsupervised
  nighttime\r scenes, the supervision information in the daytime\r scene and the texture
  information specific to the\r nighttime scene are fully utilized, and the model
  is\r adapted to both the daytime scene and the nighttime\r scene. Consistency regulation
  is used to make\r segmentation model adapt to the complex and\r changeable night
  scene texture and illumination. In\r view of the coarse correspondence of static
  objects\r between day and night image pairs in the Dark Zurich\r dataset, cross
  attention is proposed to make the\r model pay more attention to the parts of the
  night\r scene which are similar to the daytime\r scene. Extensive experiments on
  Dark Zurich and\r Nighttime Driving datasets show that our method\r obtains better
  performance in nighttime semantic\r segmentation."
