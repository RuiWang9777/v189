title: An Enhanced Human Activity Recognition Algorithm with Positional Attention
crossref: acml22
abstract: Human activity recognition (HAR) attracts widespread attention from researchers
  recently, and deep learning is employed as a dominant paradigm of solving HAR problems.
  The previous techniques rely on domain knowledge or attention mechanism extract
  long-range dependency in temporal dimension and cross channel correlation in sensor’s
  channel dimension. In this paper, a HAR model with positional attention (PA), termed
  as PA-HAR, is presented. To enhance the features in both sensor’s channel and temporal
  dimensions, we propose to split the sensor signals into two 1D features to capture
  the long-range dependency along the temporal-axis and signal’s cross-channel information
  along the sensor’s channel-axis. Furthermore, we embed the features with positional
  information by encoding the generated features into pairs of temporal-aware and
  sensor’s channel-aware attention maps and weighting the input feature maps. Extensive
  experiments based on five public datasets demonstrate that the proposed PA-HAR algorithm
  achieves a competitive performance in HAR related tasks compared with the state-of-the-art
  approaches.
