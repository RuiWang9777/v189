title: "SNAIL: Semi-Separated Uncertainty Adversarial\r Learning for Universal Domain
  Adaptation"
crossref: acml22
abstract: " Universal domain adaptation (UniDA) is a new\r sub-topic of unsupervised
  domain adaptation. It\r handles the problem that the source or target domain\r possibly
  has open-class samples. The inborn\r challenge is to detect the open-class samples
  in the\r test phase. Pioneering studies could be viewed as\r dependent-detector-based
  methods. They cleverly\r design efficient uncertainty metrics (\\eg,\r confidence,
  entropy, distance) based on the outputs\r of domain adaptation models (predictor)
  to detect\r open-class samples. However, they have a pain point\r in setting extremely-sensitive
  and task-dependent\r thresholds on the uncertainty metrics to filter\r open-class
  samples. To bypass this pain point, we\r propose a semi-separated-detector-based
  method,\r Semi-Separated Uncertainty Adversarial Learning\r (SNAIL). We build a
  semi-separated uncertainty\r decision-maker to enable sensitive-threshold-free\r
  detection. It receives multiple uncertainty metrics\r as attributes and separately
  learns the thresholds\r of uncertainty metrics in a multi-level decision\r rule.
  For some challenging tasks, the uncertainty\r margins between common and open classes
  are subtle,\r leading to difficulty learning optimal decision\r rules. We present
  the uncertainty separation loss to\r enlarge the uncertainty margin. Further, forcibly\r
  aligning the distributions could incorrectly align\r the open classes to common
  classes.  Thanks to the\r open-class detection strategy, we design the\r conditional-weighted
  adversarial loss that\r adversarially and selectively matches the feature\r distributions
  to defeat the distribution\r misalignment problem. Extensive experiments show\r
  that SNAIL remarkably outperforms the\r state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods,
  with\r over 25% improvements in open-class detection\r accuracy for some tasks."
