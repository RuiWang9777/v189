title: "One Gradient Frank-Wolfe for Decentralized Online\r Convex and Submodular
  Optimization"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "Decentralized learning has been studied intensively\r in recent years motivated
  by its wide applications\r in the context of federated learning. The majority\r
  of previous research focuses on the offline setting\r in which the objective function
  is static. However,\r the offline setting becomes unrealistic in numerous\r machine
  learning applications that witness the\r change of massive data. In this paper,
  we propose\r \\emph{decentralized online} algorithm for convex and\r continuous
  DR-submodular optimization, two classes\r of functions that are present in a variety
  of\r machine learning problems. Our algorithms achieve\r performance guarantees
  comparable to those in the\r centralized offline setting. Moreover, on average,\r
  each participant performs only a \\emph{single}\r gradient computation per time
  step. Subsequently, we\r extend our algorithms to the bandit\r setting. Finally,
  we illustrate the competitive\r performance of our algorithms in real-world\r experiments."
