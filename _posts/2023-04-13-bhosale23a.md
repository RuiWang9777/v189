title: "Learning with Domain Knowledge to Develop\r Justifiable Convolutional Networks"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "The inherent structure of the Convolutional Neural\r Networks (CNN) allows
  them to extract features that\r are highly correlated with the classes while\r performing
  image classification. However, it may\r happen that the extracted features are merely\r
  coincidental and may not be justifiable from a human\r perspective. For example,
  from a set of images of\r cows on grassland, CNN can erroneously extract grass\r
  as the feature of the class cow. There are two main\r limitations to this kind of
  learning: firstly, in\r many false-negative cases, correct features will not\r be
  used, and secondly, in false-positive cases the\r system will lack accountability.
  There is no\r implicit way to inform CNN to learn the features\r that are justifiable
  from a human perspective to\r resolve these issues. In this paper, we argue that\r
  if we provide domain knowledge to guide the learning\r process of CNN, it is possible
  to reliably learn the\r justifiable features. We propose a systematic yet\r simple
  mechanism to incorporate domain knowledge to\r guide the learning process of the
  CNNs to extract\r justifiable features. The flip side is that it needs\r additional
  input. However, we have shown that even\r with minimal additional input our method
  can\r effectively propagate the knowledge within a class\r during training. We demonstrate
  that justifiable\r features not only enhance accuracy but also demand\r less amount
  of data and training time. Moreover, we\r also show that the proposed method is
  more robust\r against perturbational changes in the input images."
