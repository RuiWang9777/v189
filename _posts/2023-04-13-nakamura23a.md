title: "Robust computation of optimal transport by\r $β$-potential regularization"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "Optimal transport (OT) has become a widely used tool\r in the machine learning
  field to measure the\r discrepancy between probability distributions. For\r instance,
  OT is a popular loss function that\r quantifies the discrepancy between an empirical\r
  distribution and a parametric model. Recently, an\r entropic penalty term and the
  celebrated Sinkhorn\r algorithm have been commonly used to approximate the\r original
  OT in a computationally efficient\r way. However, since the Sinkhorn algorithm runs
  a\r projection associated with the Kullback-Leibler\r divergence, it is often vulnerable
  to outliers. To\r overcome this problem, we propose regularizing OT\r with the $\\beta$-potential
  term associated with the\r so-called $\\beta$-divergence, which was developed in\r
  robust statistics. Our theoretical analysis reveals\r that the $\\beta$-potential
  can prevent the mass from\r being transported to outliers. We experimentally\r demonstrate
  that the transport matrix computed with\r our algorithm helps estimate a probability\r
  distribution robustly even in the presence of\r outliers. In addition, our proposed
  method can\r successfully detect outliers from a contaminated\r dataset."
