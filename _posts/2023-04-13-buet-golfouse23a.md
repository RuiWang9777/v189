title: "Robust Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning with\r Dynamic Preferences"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "This paper considers multi-objective reinforcement\r learning (MORL) when
  preferences over the multiple\r tasks are not perfectly known. Indeed, it is often\r
  the case in practice that an agent is trying to\r achieve tasks that may have competing
  goals but does\r not exactly know how to trade them off. The goal of\r MORL is thus
  to learn optimal policies under a set\r of possible preferences leading to different\r
  trade-offs on the Pareto frontier. Here, we propose\r a new method by considering
  the dynamics of\r preferences over tasks. While this is a more\r realistic setup
  in many scenarios, more importantly,\r it helps us devise a simple and straightforward\r
  approach by considering a surrogate state space made\r up of both states and preferences,
  which leads to a\r joint exploration of states and preferences. Static\r (and possibly
  unknown) preferences can also be\r understood as a limiting case of our framework.
  In\r sum, this allows us to devise both deep Q-learning\r and actor-critic methods
  based on planning under a\r preference-dependent policy and learning the\r multi-dimensional
  value function under said\r policy. Finally, the performance and effectiveness\r
  of our method are demonstrated in experiments run on\r different domains."
