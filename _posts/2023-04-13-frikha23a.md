title: Towards Data-Free Domain Generalization
crossref: acml22
abstract: "In this work, we investigate the unexplored\r intersection of domain generalization
  (DG) and\r data-free learning. In particular, we address the\r question: How can
  knowledge contained in models\r trained on different source domains be merged into
  a\r single model that generalizes well to unseen target\r domains, in the absence
  of source and target domain\r data? Machine learning models that can cope with\r
  domain shift are essential for real-world scenarios\r with often changing data distributions.
  Prior DG\r methods typically rely on using source domain data,\r making them unsuitable
  for private decentralized\r data. We define the novel problem of Data-Free\r Domain
  Generalization (DFDG), a practical setting\r where models trained on the source
  domains\r separately are available instead of the original\r datasets, and investigate
  how to effectively solve\r the domain generalization problem in that case. We\r
  propose DEKAN, an approach that extracts and fuses\r domain-specific knowledge from
  the available teacher\r models into a student model robust to domain\r shift. Our
  empirical evaluation demonstrates the\r effectiveness of our method which achieves
  first\r state-of-the-art results in DFDG by significantly\r outperforming data-free
  knowledge distillation and\r ensemble baselines."
