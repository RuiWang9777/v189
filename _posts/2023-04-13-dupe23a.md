title: Kernelized multi-graph matching
crossref: acml22
abstract: "Multigraph matching is a recent variant of the graph\r matching problem.
  In this framework, the\r optimization procedure considers several graphs and\r enforces
  the consistency of the matches along the\r graphs. This constraint can be formalized
  as a cycle\r consistency across the pairwise permutation\r matrices, which implies
  the definition of a universe\r of vertex (Pachauri et al., 2013). The label of each\r
  vertex is encoded by a sparse vector and the\r dimension of this space corresponds
  to the rank of\r the bulk permutation matrix, the matrix built from\r the aggregation
  of all the pairwise permutation\r matrices. The matching problem can then be\r formulated
  as a non-convex quadratic optimization\r problem (QAP) under constraints imposed
  on the rank\r and the permutations. In this paper, we introduce a\r novel kernelized
  multigraph matching technique that\r handles vectors of attributes on both the vertices\r
  and edges of the graphs, while maintaining a low\r memory usage. We solve the QAP
  problem using a\r projected power optimization approach and propose\r several projectors
  leading to improved stability of\r the results. We provide several experiments\r
  showingthat our method is competitive against other\r unsupervised methods."
