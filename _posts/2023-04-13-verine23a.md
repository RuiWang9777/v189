title: "On the expressivity of bi-Lipschitz normalizing\r flows"
crossref: acml22
abstract: "An invertible function is bi-Lipschitz if both the\r function and its inverse
  have bounded Lipschitz\r constants. Most state-of-the-art Normalizing Flows\r are
  bi-Lipschitz by design or by training to limit\r numerical errors (among other things).
  In this\r paper, we discuss the expressivity of bi-Lipschitz\r Normalizing Flows
  and identify several target\r distributions that are difficult to approximate\r
  using such models. Then, we characterize the\r expressivity of bi-Lipschitz Normalizing
  Flows by\r giving several lower bounds on the Total Variation\r distance between
  these particularly unfavorable\r distributions and their best possible\r approximation.
  Finally, we show how to use the\r bounds to adjust the training parameters, and\r
  discuss potential remedies."
